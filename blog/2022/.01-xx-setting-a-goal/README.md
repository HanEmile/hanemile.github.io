# setting a goal

I love to do things, even more if there is a a well defined goal to reach.

For this, I've often just set this goal so high, that it is literally unreachable, just as a challenge to see how far I can go. Not doing this would probably result in me setting the goal to low and upon reaching the goal just not continuing, that's just how I work.
