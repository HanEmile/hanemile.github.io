# visiting webrings

Webrings are wonderful structures allowing people to interconnect and to discover new things.

## Webring's in a nutshell

### Identifiers

Webrings often contain some kind of image or logo in order to be identified. 

### Direct linking

Webrings may contain some kind of link to the next and/or previous item in the ring. This allows quickly visiting new, potentially interesting, sites in the webring.

### Index

The webring's I've found provide some kind of index, in which all pages which are part of the webring are listed. A webring could work without an index, although findings items in the webring would be limited to something like direct linking. In such a case, it wouldn't take all to long before people start mapping the ring itself and building an index, so starting out with one seems reasonable.
