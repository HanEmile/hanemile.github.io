# worldtrip idea

So I've realized that I'd like to do stuff, see the world and get out of here. Now I like to do stuff that might seam unrealistic at first and set the bar quite high, so even if I don't reach it, there might be cool things that might happen.

## The way of transport

I've thought of a few ways to do this:

### By car

I'd have to do a drivers licence, buy a car, figure out how to get from A to B in a legal way (visum, ...). Overeall not my choice.

### By bike

Would be nicer, as I wouldn't be strapped to an expensive object I don't know how to repair (a car), but I'd also be limited in a way that if I ride eastwards, I'd reach china and would need some kind of way to cross the sea. Here's where the next part comes into play:

### By boat

A boat is just great: versatile, cheap (in comparison), apparently, you can do almost anything youself (you could argue that this is also the case with a card, but well, it's a car, those things are just not ment to be hackend on). In addition: it's self propelling, meaning I wouln't spend an infinite amount of money on gas, diesel or other chemicals which are annoying.

## The route
