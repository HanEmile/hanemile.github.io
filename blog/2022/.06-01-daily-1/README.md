# daily 1

So with this post, I'm onece agains tarting to write a blogpost. I'm currently
hoping to write more, although as one might expect viewing the past, I'm not
the best at following through.

These daily posts may become public some time, but at the moment, they're still
private, at least as far as I know.

## EMF-camp

So I'm currently writing this sitting at the airport waiting form y flight to
EMF-camp. EMF-camp stands for "Electro Magnetic Field" camp and is a camp
taking place every four years somewhere in the far west of England, namely the
"Eastnor Castle Deer Park".

I'm probably going to write something on the event as I come back and link to
pictures people have published, but until then, you can look at the stuff on <a
